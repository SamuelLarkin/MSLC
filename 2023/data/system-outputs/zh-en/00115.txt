The United States to upgrade the "chip War" reasss the global half - agency industry -
Recently, the US has a rapid upgrade to China’s “chip war” – the Netherlands, Japan and the United States, agreed to launch the export of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment in China; the US government is considering all links between US suppliers and Chinese suppliers to China and China to provide a product to China; a government is ready to impose a direct direct investment in the United States.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped shooting on the development of China’s “chip” development, and a semiconductor link between China and China to build "a half-generated industry chain" and a graphics designed to make a complete "dumping China" in the advanced half-dimensional industries.
In addition to the establishment of a "technician alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan region, Japan, and Taiwan, or a combination of a piece of a semiconductor industry, the United States launched a semi-constructuring strategy through a political franchise, timplifying agency, a semiconductor, and a second-classing industry in the United States.
However, the United States, however, has a drum of "chips" and a thousand damaged by the enemy.
The United States has recently been announced that the latest wheel was affected by the Chinese chip manufacturing equipment, which would hire a 1300 full-time staff and planned to hire 1400 temporary employees in the next quarter.
The company recently warned that the exports of China has been forbidden to make a half-conductive device, and may lead to a half-century price.
In the US government, many US companies have been affected by a savings such as Chinese chips and semiconductors, including electronic design, chip designer, chip manufacturers, chip manufacturing equipment, chip manufacturers and chips.
The United States called China's advanced semiconductor industry, has dragged the water to the world's half-century industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has formed close to the global semiconductor industry.
According to professionals estimate, the whole production process of semiconductor products requires more than 70 times more than 100 days.
Although the United States’s semiconductor industry is strong, it is particularly the advanced process of manufacturing, severely dependent on East Asia.
Even the US polarization of advanced chip supply chains to the United States, the distribution and mutual dependency of the relevant industrial sector is difficult to change.
The United States strongly restructured the semiconductor industry chain of China and a global semiconductor industry.
The chip is the core of the world's future industry, and the development of chip industry is not participating in global countries.
In recent years, the United States adopted a series of single-sector operations in innovation and competition bills in 2022, a chip and science bill, consolidated its own technology, and consolidated its own technology, and enforcing the "Nowl" and electronics, electronics, electronics, electronics, electronics, and three chips to ensure the global leadership of the United States.
In the short term, the United States has made trouble with Chinese chip industry and related industries.
But a long time, the US shoots China's chip industry in the bottom of the United States and ultimately loses its huge Chinese market, ultimately weakening the innovation and innovation of the US and technology enterprises, and damage the global chip industry.
